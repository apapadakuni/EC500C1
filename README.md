This APIEXERCISE.py file receives a twitter handle by a user, goes through the twitter user's tweets and downloads images that were posted on twitter. Then using the Google Cloud Vision API, we get a short description of each image, and add that to the image. Then using the FFMPEG API we concatenate all images into one video, each image being 5 seconds. 



How to use: 

compile python code in terminal: Program will prompt you for a twitter handle: Type one and hit "Enter"
